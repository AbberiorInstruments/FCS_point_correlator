<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: What datafiles does FoCuS-point support? A: Presently FoCuS-point supports '.pt3' and uncorrelated files and in the fitting software FoCuS-point supports '.SIN' correlated files and '.csv' correlated files in FoCuS-point's own format.
<p>Q: I have data files which are not '.pt3' what can I do?  A: You can create an issue using github and I will make the software support your file format if possible. Furthermore you can write a parser which converts your file format to the FoCuS-point generic format which is comma delimited.
